Mouse Data: The dataset contains information about mice in different treatment regimens, including details such as Mouse ID, Drug Regimen, Sex, Age in months, Weight in grams, Timepoint, Tumor Volume (mm3), and Metastatic Sites.

Summary Statistics: Summary statistics have been calculated for the tumor volume for each drug regimen, including mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and standard error of the mean (SEM).

Number of Mice: The clean DataFrame contains 248 mice.

IQR and Outliers: The Interquartile Range (IQR) and potential outliers have been calculated for the tumor volume of mice in each treatment regimen. Potential outliers are detected for the Infubinol regimen.

Correlation Coefficient and Linear Regression: The correlation coefficient between mouse weight and average observed tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen has been calculated. Additionally, a linear regression model has been created, and a scatter plot with the linear regression line has been generated.

Analysis:

Drug Regimen Comparison: The summary statistics provide insights into the distribution of tumor volumes across different drug regimens. For instance, Capomulin and Ramicane have lower mean and median tumor volumes compared to other regimens, suggesting potentially more effective treatments.

Outliers: The presence of potential outliers in the Infubinol regimen indicates variability in tumor response among mice receiving this treatment. Further investigation into these outliers may provide insights into treatment efficacy or mouse-specific factors influencing tumor growth.

Correlation and Linear Regression: The positive correlation coefficient between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen suggests a relationship between these variables. The linear regression model further confirms this relationship, showing that as mouse weight increases, average tumor volume tends to increase as well. This analysis could aid in understanding the impact of weight on treatment response and guide future research or treatment strategies.

Overall, the provided results offer valuable insights into the efficacy and effects of different drug regimens on tumor growth in mice, providing a foundation for further analysis and interpretation in preclinical research.
